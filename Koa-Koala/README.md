# Koa Koala

This is a Node.js application built using the Koa framework. Koa feels somewhat like Express to me, in that it requires lots of middleware to be able to set up even a basic web application. At this time, the backend of the app passes the data directly to the frontend, but it is my intention as I continue to learn more about the Koa framework to add a database layer as well. Stay tuned!
