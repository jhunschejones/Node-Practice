# Rock Paper Scissors Express

This is a practice web application originally developed by Jon Peck. It allows two users to play a game of rock-paper-scissors. I have made some of my own modifications and used it to complete Jon's *Node.js Debugging and Performance Tuning* course. I do not own this application, but the debugging and problem-solving work displayed here is my own. During this project I practiced:

* Running a MySQL database in Docker
* Using pm2 to manage a microservice application arcitecture
* Logging using the Winston library
* Creating request logs with the Morgan library
* Cross-appliation request correlation
