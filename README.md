# Node-Practice

This repository demonstrates my learning process as I worked to gain familiarity with a few popular Node.js frameworks during the spring and summer of 2018. As my skillet grew, I added additional projects, including an application logging project. Click into the folders below to see more detail about individual applications and APIâ€™s. 

* [To-Do List API built with Hapi](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Node-Practice/tree/master/Hapi-To-Do)
* [Fitbit API buit with Hapi](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Node-Practice/tree/master/Hapi-Fitbit)
* [To-Do List API built with Restify](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Node-Practice/tree/master/Restify-To-Do)
