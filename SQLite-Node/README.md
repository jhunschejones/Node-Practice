# SQLite-Node

## Overview
This is the repository folder for the first draft of the Node.js project I built for my [Node-Restify-New-Relic demo](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Node-Restify-New-Relic). It uses the Restify framework to host a handful of backend API endpoints and a single-page web app that enables a user to preform GET, POST and DELETE methods on a SQLite database. I recommend checking out the [final project](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Node-Restify-New-Relic) if you are interested in building your own version of this application, or for further information.
